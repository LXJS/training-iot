# Lesson 1: BMP085 module

In this lesson, we are going to use the 'bmp085' module to measure temperature and pressure off of our AirPi device. The 'bmp085' module is just one of hundreds of modules that already exist for working with different hardware devices in npm.

## Instructions

1. Shell into your device using the ip address written on the bottom.
2. All of the code you need for this training is in ~ (/home/pi).
3. Write the code in device.js to 1) take the air temperature and pressure and 2) print it out.
4. Run `npm install` to fetch all of your dependencies.
5. Run `node device.js` on the device.
