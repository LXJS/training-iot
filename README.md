Internet of Things Training
===========================

## Description

Over the next decade how we interact with computers will shift to a much more pervasive model on based on deeper integration into the everyday things in our lives.

In this training, we are going to jump in and get our hands dirty with hardware and learn how open hardware has put building real world devices within the reach of all of us.

In particular, we are going to build a global climate monitoring system around the AirPi shield for the Raspberry Pi.

## With this training, you will learn

* 1: How you can use I2C to connect lots of interesting chips and sensors.
* 2: Use the 'bmp085' module with node.js on the Raspberry Pi to measure the temperature of the room.
* 3: How to build a Nitrogen device for this module that can collect this data.
* 4: How to build an application that combines all of the sensors in the room into a climate monitoring map.

## Preparations for this training

In order to prepare to this training you should do the following list of readings and exercises. If you have questions, please open an issue and we will be glad to answer (you are probably helping other participants too!)

### Reading

* 1: [I2C](http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/acatalog/I2C_Tutorial.html): This is a hardware communications bus that many chips include support for. Don't worry if you don't understand everything in this article - focus on understanding the first diagram.
* 2: [AirPi](http://airpi.es): A climate shield for the Raspberry Pi that we'll use for this training.
* 3: [i2c module](https://github.com/kelly/node-i2c): Base module for many modules that interface with i2c devices.
* 4: [bmp085 module](https://github.com/fiskeben/bmp085): Module that provides support for the [BMP085](https://www.adafruit.com/products/391) that measure temperature and pressure.
