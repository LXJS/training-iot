## Description

The nature of computing is changing. Over the next decade computing will shift from our current conception of a screen with an input device to a much more distributed model on based on deeper integration into the everyday things in our lives.

In this training, we are going to get our hands dirty with hardware and discover that open hardware has put building real world devices within the reach of all of us. Naturally, we are going to have fun too.
