## Description

We are going to jump in and get our hands dirty with hardware on a real problem. We'll learn how open hardware, and rich node.js module support for this hardware, has put building real world devices within the reach of all of us. In this training, we are going to build a global climate monitoring system around the AirPi shield for the Raspberry Pi.

## With this training, you will learn

* 1: How you can use I2C to connect lots of interesting chips and sensors.
* 2: Use the 'bmp085' module with node.js on the Raspberry Pi to measure the temperature of the room.
* 3: How to build a Nitrogen device for this module that can collect and distribute this data.
* 4: How to build an application that combines all of the sensors in the room (and elsewhere) into a climate monitoring map.

## Preparations for this training

In order to prepare to this training you should do the following list of readings and exercises. If you have questions, please open an issue and we will be glad to answer (you are probably helping other participants too!)

### Reading

* 1: [I2C](http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/acatalog/I2C_Tutorial.html): This is a hardware communications bus that many chips include support for. Don't worry if you don't understand everything in this article - focus on understanding the first diagram.
* 3: [i2c module](https://github.com/kelly/node-i2c): Modules that makes communicating with many devices based on I2C possible.
* 2: [AirPi](http://airpi.es): A climate shield for the Raspberry Pi that we'll use for this training.
* 4: [bmp085 module](https://github.com/fiskeben/bmp085): Module that provides support for the [BMP085 chip](https://www.adafruit.com/products/391) that measures temperature and pressure.
* 5: [Nitrogen Overview](http://nitrogen.io/docs/concepts/overview.html): An overview of the Nitrogen platform and how it works.
* 6: [BMP085 Nitrogen device](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/devices/tree/master/bmp085): Nitrogen device that takes measurements off of the BMP085 and sends telemetry messages.

### Prep work

* 1: Register for a [Nitrogen account](http://admin.nitrogen.io)
* 2: Work through the [laptop camera guide](http://nitrogen.io/guides/start/setup.html)
